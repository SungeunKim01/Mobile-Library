        Dr. Strauss says I should write down what I think and remember. 
        He says it’s like keeping a diary. I hope they use me for the experiment. 
        Miss Kinnian says maybe they can make me smart. I want to be smart. My
        name is Charlie Gordon. I am 37 years old and 2 weeks ago was my brithday.

        I had a test today. I think I faled it. and I think that maybe now they wont
        use me. What happind is a nice young man was in the room and he had some
        white cards with ink spillled all over them. He sed Charlie what do you see
        on this card. I was very skared even tho I had my rabits foot in my pockit
        because when I was a kid I always faled tests in school and I spillled ink to.
        I told him I saw a inkblot. He said yes and it made me feel good. I thot
        that was all but when I got up to go he stopped me. He said now sit down
        Charlie we are not thru yet. Then I dont remember so good but he wan tid me
        to say what was in the ink. I dint see nuthing in the ink but he said there was
        picturs there other pepul saw some picturs. I coudnt see any picturs. I reely
        tryed to see. I held the card close up and then far away. Then I said if 1 had
        my glases I coud see better I usally only ware my glases in the movies or TV
        but 1 said they are in the closh in the hall. I got them. Then I said let me see
        that card agen I bet III find it now.
        I tryed hard but I still coudnt find the picturs I only saw the ink. 1 told
        him maybe 1 need new glases. He rote somthing down on a paper and I got
        skared of faling the test. I told him it was a very nice inkblot with littel points
        all around the eges. He looked very sad so that wasnt it. I said please let me
        try agen. III get it in a few minits becaus 1m not so fast somtimes. 1m a slow
        reeder too in Miss Kinnians class for slow adults but I'm trying very hard.
        He gave me a chance with another card that had 2 kinds of ink spilled
        on it red and blue.
        He was very nice and talked slow like Miss Kinnian does and he ex
        planed it to me that it was a raw shok. He said pepul see things in the ink.
        I said show me where. He said think. I told him I think a inkblot but that
        wasnt rite eather. He said what does it remind you-pretend something. 1
        closd my eyes for a long time to pretend. I told him I pretend a fowntan pen
        with ink leeking all over a table cloth. Then he got up and went out.
        1 dont think I passd the raw shok test.

        Dr Strauss and Dr Nemur say it dont matter about the inkblots. I told them 
        I dint spill the ink on the cards and I coudnt see anything in the ink. They said 
        that maybe they will still use me. I said Miss Kinnian never gave me tests like
        that one only spelling and reading. They said Miss Kinnian told that I was her
        bestist pupil in the adult nite scool becaus I tryed the hardist and I reely
        wantid to lern. They said how come you went to the adult nite scool all by
        yourself Charlie. How did you find it. I said I askd pepul and sumbody told
        me where I shud go to lern to read and spell good. They said why did you want
        to. I told them becaus all my life I wantid to be smart and not dumb. But its
        very hard to be smart. They said you know it will probly be tempirery. I said
        yes. Miss Kinnian told me. I dont care if it herts.
        Later I had more crazy tests today. The nice lady who gave it me told
        me the name and I asked her how do you spellit so I can rite it in my progris
        riport. THEMATIC APPERCEPTION TEST. I dont know the frist 2 words but I know
        what test means. You got to pass it or you get bad marks. This test lookd easy
        becaus I coud see the picturs. Only this time she dint want me to tell her the
        picturs. That mixd me up. I said the man yesterday said I shoud tell him what
        I saw in the ink she said that dont make no difrence. She said make up storys
        about the pepul in the picturs.
        I told her how can you tell storys about pepul you never met. I said why
        shud I make up lies. I never tell lies any more becaus I always get caut.
        She told me this test and the other one the raw-shok was for getting
        personalty. I laffed so hard. I said how can you get that thing from inkblots
        and fotos. She got sore and put her picturs away. I dont care. It was siIy. I gess
        I faled that test too.
        Later some men in white coats took me to a difernt part of the hospitil
        and gave me a game to play. It was like a race with a white mouse. They called
        the mouse Algernon. Algernon was in a box with a lot of twists and turns like
        all-kinds of walls and they gave me a pencil and a paper with lines and lots
        of boxes. On one side it said START and on the other end it said FINISH. They
        said it was amazed and that Algernon and me had the same amazed to do.
        I dint see how we could have the same amazed if Algernon had a box and I
        had a paper but I dint say nothing. Anyway there wasnt time because the race
        started.
        One of the men had a watch he was trying to hide so I woudnt see it so
        I tryed not to look and that made me nervus.
        Anyway that test made me feel worser than all the others because they
        did it over 10 times with difernt amazeds and Algernon won every time. I dint
        know that mice were so smart. Maybe thats because Algernon is a white
        mouse. Maybe white mice are smarter then other mice.

        Their going to use me! 1m so exited I can hardly write. Dr Nemur and Dr
        Strauss had a argament about it first. Dr Nemur was in the office when Dr
        Strauss brot me in. Dr Nemur was worryed about using me but Dr Strauss
        told him Miss Kinnian rekemmended me the best from all the people who she
        was teaching. I like Miss Kinnian becaus shes a very smart teacher. And she
        said Charlie your going to have a second chance. If you volenteer for this
        experamenl you mite get smart. They dont know if it will be perminint but
        theirs a chance. Thats why I said ok even when I was scared because she said
        it was an operashun. She said dont be scared Charlie you done so much with
        so little I think you deserv it most of all.
        
        So I got scaird when Dr Nemur and Dr Strauss argud about it. Dr Strauss
        said I had something that was very good. He said I had a good motor-vation.
        I never even knew I had that. I felt proud when he said that not every body
        with an eye-q of 68 had that thing. I dont know what it is or where I got it
        but he said Algernon had it too. Algernons motor-vation is the cheese they put
        in his box. But it cant be that because I didnt eat any cheese this week.
        Then he told Dr Nemur something I dint understand so while they were
        talking I wrote down some of the words.
        He said Dr Nemur I know Charlie is not what you had in mind as the
        first of your new brede of intelek,Hr (coudnt get the word) superman. But most
        people of his low menr"'* are host~d' and uncoop'~~' they are usualy dull
        apath,'0': and hard to reach. He has a good natcher hes intristed and eager to
        please.
        Dr Nemur said remember he will be the first human beeng ever to have
        his intelijence trippled by surgicle meens.
        Dr Strauss said exakly. Look at how well hes lerned to read and write
        for his low mentel age its as grate an acheve H as you and I lerning einstines
        therey of **vity without help. That shows the intenss motor-vation. Its com
        parat** a tremen** achev** I say we use Charlie.
        I dint get all the words and they were talking to fast but it sounded like
        Dr Strauss was on my side and like the other one wasnt.
        Then Dr Nemur nodded he said all right maybe your right. We will use
        Charlie. When he said that I got so exited I jumped up and shook his hand
        for being so good to me. I told him thank you doc you wont be sorry for giving
        me a second chance. And I mean it like I told him. After the operashun 1m
        gonna try to be smart. Im gonna try awful hard.

        1m skared. Lots of people who work here and the nurses and the people who
        gave me the tests came to bring me candy and wish me luck. I hope I have
        luck. I got my rabits foot and my lucky penny and my horse shoe. Only a black
        cat crossed me when I was comming to the hospitil. Dr Strauss says dont be
        supersitis Charlie this is sience. Anyway 1m keeping my rabits foot with me.
        I.asked Dr Strauss if Ill beat Algernon in the race after the operashun
        and he said maybe. If the operashun works III show that mouse I can be as
        smart as he is. Maybe smarter. Then III be abel to read better and spell the
        words good and know lots of things and be like other people. I want to be
        smart like other people. If it works perminint they will make everybody smart
        all over the wurld.
        They dint give me anything to eat this morning. I dont know what that
        eating has to do with getting smart. 1m very hungry and Dr Nemur took away
        my box of candy. That Dr Nemur is a grouch. Dr Strauss says I can have it
        back after the operashun. You cant eat befor a operashun ...

        The operashun dint hurt. He did it while I was sleeping. They took off the
        bandijis from my eyes and my head today so I can make a PROGRESS REPORT.
        Dr Nemur who looked at some of my other ones says I spell PROGRESS wrong
        and he told me how to spell it and REPORT too. I got to try and remember that.
        I have a very bad memary for spelling. Dr Strauss says its ok to tell about
        all the things that happin to me but he says I shoud tell more about what I
        feel and what I think. When I told him I dont know how to think he said try.
        All the time when the bandijis were on my eyes I tryed to think. Nothing
        happened. I dont know what to think about. Maybe if I ask him he will tell
        me how I can think now that 1m suppose to get smart. What do smart people
        think about. Fancy things I suppose. I wish I knew some fancy things alredy.

        Nothing is happining. I had lots of tests and different kinds of races with
        Algernon. I hate that mouse. He always beats me. Dr Strauss said I got to play
        those games. And he said some time I got to take those tests over again. Thse
        inkblots are stupid. And those pictures are stupid too. I like to draw a picture
        of a man and a woman but I wont make up lies about people.
        I got a headache from trying to think so much. I that Dr Strauss was my
        frend but he dont help me. He dont tell me what to think or when III get smart.
