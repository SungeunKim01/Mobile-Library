## Overview 

A Android studio developped mobile reading applications that allows readers to read three pre-downloaded books:
    1. Moby Dick 
    2. Pride and Prejudice 
    3. The Odyssey
Users have the choice of adding their own book to the reading list that will then be parsed and ready to read with the same 
features as the pre-downloaded books 

When a books is selected, redirects the user to the table of content screen for the user to select a chapter from the book and begin 
reading from that chapter 

When reading a book, the user has the ability to allow Text-To-Speech functionality to read the book for them. 
Users then have the ability to pause, unpause and stop TTS from reading the book 

Search functionality is also implemented to allow the user to search for keywords within all the books and then redirects to that search area
